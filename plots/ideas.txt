CoEv vs. RND - CoEv_1xXX_vs_RND_100x100pdf / CoEv_1xXX_vs_RND_100x100pdf

GA vs. RND is CLEARLY better.

GA assumes that the opponent does NOTHING.
CoEv fights again 3 opponents picked randomly (fitness: mean).

If GA assumes the opponent is RND, against RND, results are better (than assuming the opponent is NULL) for some MA values.
